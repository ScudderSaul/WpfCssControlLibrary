# WpfCssControlLibrary
A library for a Css file generating addition to web page generation programs. 
I moved the code from the visual studio extension 'CssComposition' I wrote 
into a library and modifed it to run as a extension to applications other than Visual Studio.
This version uses a database Sqlite and not the database used in the Visual Studio extentsion.
I have also created a repository for a Wpf Application version that can be used independatly to create Css scripts.

The port is still in progress so for now use at some risk.
