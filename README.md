# WpfCssControlLibrary
A library for a Css file generating addition to web page generation programs. 
I moved the code from the visual studio extension 'CssComposition'  
into the a library and modifed it to run in applications other than Visual Studio.
This version uses Sqlite not the same database as is used in the Visual Studio extentsion.
The port is still in progress so for now use at some risk.
