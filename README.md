# WpfCssControlLibrary
A library for a Css file generating addition to other programs. 
I moved the code from the visual studio extension 'CssComposition' that I wrote 
into a library and modifed it to run as a extension to applications other than Visual Studio.
This version uses a Sqlite database and not the database used bye Visual Studio extentsion.
I have also created a repository for a Wpf Application version that can be used independatly to create Css scripts.
https://github.com/ScudderSaul/WpfGenerateCssScript I recomend using the wpf application or the
visual studio extension as this version is not as usefull.
Some bugs exist so for now use with caution.

jan 15 2025 Modified to no longer use an older visual library the change is untested.
